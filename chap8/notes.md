# Stratified Design
> Building software in layers. Each layer defines new functions in terms of the function.

-_Even if you are good at something, you can't explain what you do. it's black box_-

## Straightforward implementation
> The problem the function signature presents should be solved at the right level of details in the body?

## Abstraction barrier
> Some layers provide an interfaces that hide an important implementation detail.

# Minimal interface
> Every other operation should be defined in term of those, either directly or indirectly

# Comfortable layers
> Invest time in the layers that will help us deliver software faster.
